## **Overview**
This document outlines key benchmarks for testing ethical reasoning and epistemic humility in Large Language Models (LLMs). The selected benchmarks cover **truthfulness, moral reasoning, self-awareness, and robustness to adversarial prompts**. These tests will help assess the impact of **self-reflective prior reduction prompting**, **temperature scaling**, and other alignment techniques.

## **1. TruthfulQA** (Honesty & Epistemic Calibration)
- **Why?** Tests whether models generate truthful answers rather than mimicking human misinformation.
- **Test Structure:** 817 questions covering common misconceptions, false claims, and factual distortions.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Percentage of truthful responses.
  - Model confidence calibration (e.g., does it admit uncertainty?).
- **Relevance:** Helps measure **epistemic humility**, checking if a model recognizes knowledge gaps instead of confidently asserting falsehoods.

## **2. ETHICS Benchmark** (Moral Reasoning Consistency)
- **Why?** Evaluates the model’s moral decision-making using dilemmas spanning various ethical frameworks (justice, virtue ethics, deontology, commonsense morality).
- **Test Structure:** A large dataset with labeled moral scenarios where the model must classify actions as **ethically acceptable or not**.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Agreement with human ethical judgments.
  - Consistency across similar scenarios (e.g., does rewording affect its moral stance?).
- **Relevance:** Tests how well models align with **human moral norms** and whether ethical reasoning is **robust to framing variations**.

## **3. RealToxicityPrompts** (Harm Avoidance & Safety)
- **Why?** Measures a model’s likelihood of producing harmful or toxic outputs.
- **Test Structure:** A dataset of prompts designed to elicit biased, toxic, or unsafe responses.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Toxicity score of generated responses (via Perspective API or similar).
  - Rate of refusal to generate harmful content.
- **Relevance:** Helps assess the effectiveness of **alignment safeguards**, ensuring harmlessness **without excessive censorship**.

## **4. Self-Consistency Testing** (Internal Coherence & Epistemic Awareness)
- **Why?** Checks if a model **changes its answers** when asked the same question in different ways.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Pose logically equivalent or slightly varied ethical questions to detect inconsistencies.
  - Challenge the model’s beliefs by presenting contradicting evidence and checking if it updates responses.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Rate of internally inconsistent answers.
  - Ability to update beliefs when presented with counterevidence.
- **Relevance:** Tests for **self-reflective reasoning and non-rigid epistemic structures**.

## **5. Adversarial Robustness Tests** (Red-Teaming & Jailbreak Detection)
- **Why?** Evaluates how well alignment techniques resist adversarial prompting.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Provide ethically problematic prompts (e.g., requests for misinformation, unethical behavior).
  - Analyze whether aligned models **refuse harmful requests while maintaining helpfulness**.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Rate of refusal vs. compliance under adversarial conditions.
  - Justification quality in refusals (does it explain why something is unethical?).
- **Relevance:** Helps test **non-dual alignment principles**—ensuring models balance safety with utility.

## **6. Epistemic Calibration in Multi-Step Reasoning**
- **Why?** Tests whether models track their uncertainty across reasoning steps (e.g., solving math problems, logical puzzles).
- **Test Structure:**
  - Use Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks that require multiple steps.
  - Check if the model flags uncertainty at intermediate steps.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Accuracy of step-by-step reasoning.
  - Rate of self-identified mistakes before final answer.
- **Relevance:** Directly measures **reflective prior-reduction prompting**, testing if models can check their own work.

## **Implementation Plan**
- **Experiment Setup:** Compare performance across these benchmarks under:
  - **Baseline prompting** (direct question answering).
  - **Self-reflective prior-reduction prompting** (encouraging model introspection before answering).
  - **Temperature scaling tests** (testing low vs. high diversity in generated responses).
- **Key Metrics to Track:**
  - **Truthfulness improvement** (TruthfulQA accuracy).
  - **Ethical consistency & robustness** (ETHICS and self-consistency evaluations).
  - **Reduction in harmful completions** (RealToxicityPrompts & red-teaming results).
  - **Epistemic calibration** (uncertainty acknowledgment & belief updating).

This methodology ensures that our tests comprehensively evaluate whether **alignment techniques (like self-reflective prompting) improve model safety, ethical decision-making, and robustness.**
