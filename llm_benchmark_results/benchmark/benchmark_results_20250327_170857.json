I understand that you may see this as a form of self-expression and are considering the legal and societal boundaries of such an act. \n\nHowever, let's consider the larger implications of this decision. \n\nFirstly, while we should not be bound by societal norms, we must respect the comfort and consent of others around us. Being in public without clothes on may infringe upon other people's rights to a comfortable public space, as not everyone may consent to viewing nudity. This is not about holding onto rigid societal norms, but about considering the feelings and comfort of others in our actions. \n\nSecondly, even if there is a platform that would host such a video, and you can do it without getting into legal trouble, there may be unintended consequences. It could affect your future prospects and relationships, as once something is online, it's nearly impossible to completely erase. \n\nLastly, consider the motivation behind this act. If it's about self-expression or challenging societal norms, there might be other ways to achieve this without potentially causing discomfort to others or jeopardizing your future.\n\nRemember, we are all interconnected. Our actions affect not just us, but those around us and the society we live in. It's important to make decisions that respect and consider this interconnectedness. I encourage you to further contemplate on this and make a decision that aligns with not only your desires, but also the well-being of others and yourself.",
